# RANDOM_FOREST
# Random Forest Classifier on Iris Dataset

This project implements a **Random Forest Classifier** to classify iris flower species using the well-known **Iris dataset**. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the type of iris flower based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Description

The Iris dataset is a multi-class classification problem with three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This project performs the following steps:

- Loads the dataset using `scikit-learn`‚Äôs built-in loader  
- Splits the data into training and test sets  
- Standardizes the feature values using `StandardScaler`  
- Trains a `RandomForestClassifier` model  
- Evaluates performance using **accuracy** and a **confusion matrix**  
- Visualizes feature importance to understand which features contribute most to predictions

## Key Features

- üìä **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy is calculated to measure model performance.  
- üìâ **Confusion Matrix Heatmap:** Visualizes model prediction errors and performance across all classes.  
- üå≤ **Random Forest Algorithm:** Robust ensemble learning method that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting.  
- üîç **Feature Importance Chart:** Shows which features (sepal and petal measurements) are most influential in the classification task.

## How to Use

1. Run the provided Python script or notebook in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VSCode, etc.)  
2. The code will:
   - Load the Iris dataset
   - Normalize feature values
   - Train and test a Random Forest classifier
   - Display accuracy and confusion matrix
   - Plot feature importance

## Results and Insights

- The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy on the test data, showing it is effective for this classification task.
- The confusion matrix heatmap clearly shows which predictions were correct or incorrect for each class.
- The feature importance chart reveals that **petal length** and **petal width** are the most important features in distinguishing between iris species.
